Made this post so I could better understand how to link photos in mdx
and learn how it really works. Was confused for about 6 hours cause I thought doing /blog/name of picture link was
the answer but it was really just ./ whatever the link to the picture.

Glad I figured it out cause now I know but now its time to move onto sanity,
even though I don't like the backend I am still determined to understand how sanity works too.
